This project challenged me in ways I hadn't anticipated. Learning JavaScript has been akin to acquiring a new language, requiring both time and perseverance. While I believe the time allocated to this subject was somewhat limited, I hope the final result reflects the effort invested. 

My brother, a teacher, has often highlighted one of the major issues facing today’s younger generation: comprehension. The question, "Do you understand what you just read?" is one that frequently arises in the classroom. With this in mind, I sought to create an engaging story filled with dynamic characters—an approach designed to enhance reading comprehension while simultaneously improving vocabulary skills.

Each section of the story is followed by a quick quiz to test comprhension. It was planned in this manner, firstly to reduce the quantity of information that needs to be worked through and secondly to keep the readers attention.

- As this site is dedicated to education, I chose the colors accordingly.
   - #f5b705 (Yellow): Yellow is often associated with positivity, energy, and happiness. It encourages creativity and optimism, which are essential for a learning environment.
   - #589dd9 (Blue): Blue represents trust, calmness, and reliability. These traits are important for an educational website to foster confidence and comfort among users.
                       Blue is known to improve focus and encourage a sense of stability, which can help users engage more deeply with the content.
   - #3f9004 (Green): Green symbolizes growth, learning, and harmony, which are directly connected to the goals of education.
   - #d99007 (Orange): Orange combines the energy of yellow and the stability of red, often representing enthusiasm and determination. It can be used to motivate users and 
                         create a sense of excitement about learning.
