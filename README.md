This project challenged me in ways I hadn't anticipated. Learning JavaScript has been akin to acquiring a new language, requiring both time and perseverance. While I believe the time allocated to this subject was somewhat limited, I hope the final result reflects the effort invested.

My brother, a teacher, has often highlighted one of the major issues facing todayâ€™s younger generation: comprehension. The question, "Do you understand what you just read?" is one that frequently arises in the classroom. With this in mind, I sought to create an engaging story filled with dynamic characters, an approach designed to enhance reading comprehension while simultaneously improving vocabulary skills.

The website offers quick quiz to test comprhension and some fun with a flip game. It was planned in this manner, firstly to reduce the quantity of information that needs to be worked through and secondly to keep the readers attention. The scope of what the site can become is large and many extra efatures can be loaded in the future.

I really hope you enjoy the site, not only for the visually appealing elements, but also the wonderful characters it brings to life.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/documentation/colors.webp" alt="Color Pallette">
</div>

- As this site is dedicated to education, I chose the colors accordingly.
  - #f5b705 (Yellow): Yellow is often associated with positivity, energy, and happiness. It encourages creativity and optimism, which are essential for a learning environment.
  - #589dd9 (Blue): Blue represents trust, calmness, and reliability. These traits are important for an educational website to foster confidence and comfort among users.
    Blue is known to improve focus and encourage a sense of stability, which can help users engage more deeply with the content.
  - #3f9004 (Green): Green symbolizes growth, learning, and harmony, which are directly connected to the goals of education.
  - #d99007 (Orange): Orange combines the energy of yellow and the stability of red, often representing enthusiasm and determination. It can be used to motivate users and
    create a sense of excitement about learning.

### Images

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/documentation/images.jpg" alt="Images">
</div>

- Images were all created using AI in [Freepik](https://de.freepik.com).
- The mood of the website is whimsical and I wanted the imagery to reflect that.
- AI was used as my story is original and I was unable to find the images that fit.
