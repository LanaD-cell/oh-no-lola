        <!-- start of story -->
        <h1>Once upon a time,</h1>
        <p>In a peaceful pond nestled in the heart of a magical forest, there lived a fluffy duckling named Lola. She
            was kind, curious, and always eager to help others. Today was a big day—her first day of school! But to get
            there, Lola had to walk through the forest alone for the very first time.

            With a deep breath and a little quack of determination, Lola waddled into the forest. The sunlight filtered
            through the tall trees, and birds sang happy songs. Lola smiled but kept her little wings close to her
            sides. She wasn’t just excited—she was nervous.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h2 class="card-title">Oh, where could it be?</h2>
                        <p class="card-text">As she waddled along, she heard a frustrated voice behind a bush.

                            “Oh, where could it be? I can’t find it anywhere!”

                            Curious, Lola peeked around the bush and saw a small porcupine pacing in circles. His
                            quills were sticking out in all directions.

                            “Hello! I’m Lola,” she said kindly. “Are you okay?”

                            The porcupine sighed. “I’m Percy. I’ve lost my hat! I was wearing it earlier, but now
                            it’s gone, and I can’t find it!”

                            Lola tilted her head. “When did you last see it?”

                            Percy scratched his head with a quill. “Um… I don’t know. I was walking and looking at
                            flowers, and then it was gone!”

                            Lola thought for a moment. She noticed how flustered Percy looked. “Let’s slow down and
                            check carefully,” she said.

                            Percy nodded, though he kept pacing.

                            “Stop moving for a second, Percy,” Lola said gently. As Percy stood still, Lola waddled
                            closer and gasped.

                            “Percy, your hat is stuck in your quills! It’s been with you this whole time!”

                            Percy’s eyes widened as Lola carefully tugged the hat free. “Oh my quills!” he
                            exclaimed. “How did I not notice?”

                            Lola giggled. “Sometimes, we get so worried that we forget to stop and look carefully.
                            If we’re patient, the answer can be right in front of us.”

                            Percy nodded, blushing. “You’re right, Lola. I need to be more patient. Thank you for
                            helping me!”

                            “You’re welcome, Percy. Enjoy your walk!”

                            Percy waved goodbye, and Lola continued through the forest, feeling happy that she could
                            help.

                        <p class="card-text">As she waddled deeper into the forest, Lola spotted a tiny green worm
                            crying on top of a red mushroom.

                            “Hey there, my name is Lola! What’s wrong?” Lola asked, waddling closer.

                            The worm sniffled. “Oh no Lola, I’m Butter and I am terribly sad. I just want to go to
                            normal school, make friends, play and learn. My parents are making me go to flying
                            school. I don’t want to go to flying school! I’m just a worm!
                            How can I possibly fly when I don’t even have wings?”

                            Lola smiled warmly. “Oh Butter, did anyone tell you that one day you’ll be a butterfly?”

                            Butter blinked. “A… butterfly? Me?”

                            Lola nodded. “Yes! One day, you’ll have big, beautiful wings, and you’ll fly all over
                            the place.”

                            Butter looked down at her little worm body. “But I don’t have wings now. What if I never
                            get them?”

                            Lola chuckled. “Wings take time to grow, Butter. But just because you don’t see them now
                            doesn’t mean they’re not coming. Hope is believing in what’s possible, even when you
                            can’t see it yet.”

                            Butter sniffled but smiled. “So… I just have to wait and trust that I’ll be a butterfly
                            one day?”

                            “That’s right,” Lola said. “And when the time comes, your wings will be amazing!”

                            Butter wiggled happily. “Thank you, Lola! I feel much better. I’ll go to flying school
                            and wait for my wings!”

                            “That’s the spirit!” Lola said, waving goodbye as Butter wriggled off.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">As Lola walked farther, the sunlight began to fade, casting long
                            shadows across the forest floor. Suddenly, she heard a soft whimper. Curious, she
                            followed the sound and found a small fox trapped in a rope snare. Its fluffy tail
                            twitched nervously.

                            “Oh no!” Lola exclaimed, her heart racing. “Are you okay?”

                            The fox looked up with wide, frightened eyes. “Please help me!” it whimpered.

                            Lola hesitated. Her mommy had always warned her to be careful of foxes. “Foxes can be
                            sneaky and tricky,” her mommy had said. “Sometimes, they might even try to hurt you.”

                            But this fox looked so scared and helpless. Lola’s heart tugged at her.

                            “You’re a fox,” she said cautiously. “How do I know you won’t hurt me if I help you?”

                            The fox’s eyes filled with tears. “I know foxes have a bad reputation, but I promise I
                            won’t hurt you. I’m just a baby, and I’m really scared!”

                            Lola took a deep breath. “Okay. I’m going to trust you. Stay still while I help you.”

                            Carefully, Lola found a sharp stone nearby and began to cut the rope. It took time, but
                            finally, the snare loosened, and the fox was free.

                            The fox jumped up, wagging its tail. “Thank you, thank you! You saved me!”

                            “You’re welcome,” Lola said with a smile. “But you need to be more careful. The forest
                            can be dangerous.”

                            The fox nodded. “I will! I know you were scared to help me, but you trusted me. I’ll
                            never forget your kindness.”

                            “Well, sometimes it’s okay to trust, even when you’re afraid,” Lola said. “Just be sure
                            to trust wisely.”

                            The fox beamed. “You’re brave and kind, Lola. Maybe we can be friends?”

                            Lola smiled. “Maybe. Be safe out there!”

                            As Lola continued her journey, she felt proud of all she had learned. Percy taught her
                            the value of patience, Butter reminded her to always have hope, and the fox showed her
                            that trust can overcome fear.

                            By the time she reached school, Lola knew she was ready for anything. With kindness,
                            courage, and a little quack of determination, she waddled into class, excited for the
                            adventures ahead.

                            As she waddled up, she spotted other animals chatting—bunnies, squirrels, and ducklings.
                            They swapped morning adventures like they’d just come back from summer camp. Lola puffed

                            her feathers. “I walked here alone, helped a porcupine find his hat, a caterpillar
                            figure
                            out flying school, and saved a baby fox from a snare!” she quacked.

                            The teacher, a wise old owl with glasses bigger than her head, beamed. “Impressive,
                            Lola!
                            You’re already overqualified.”

                            Inside, Lola plopped onto a tiny desk, her feet barely touching the floor. The classroom
                            was
                            cozy, with sunbeams, posters, and at least five snacks tucked into squirrel backpacks.

                            The owl kicked off the day with, “The forest is awesome! Every animal’s got a job, even
                            if
                            it’s just not being eaten!” Lola soaked it all up like a sponge.

                            By the end of the day, she had new friends, more stories, and a brain stuffed with
                            forest
                            facts. As she waddled home, Lola quacked to herself, “School’s awesome! Plus, no ropes,
                            no
                            porcupines, just snacks and naps. I could get used to this!”
