        <!-- start of story -->
        <h1>Once upon a time,</h1>
        <p>in a peaceful little pond nestled in the heart of a magical forest, there lived a small,
            fluffy duckling named Lola. Lola was gentle, kind, and always eager to lend a helping hand—well, a helping
            wing! She had a heart full of love and curiosity about the world around her.

            One sunny morning, Lola woke up excited and a little nervous. Today was a very special day—it was her first
            day of school! She had been dreaming about this day for so long, and now, at last, it had come. But there
            was something else that made Lola's heart beat faster. To reach her school, Lola had to walk through the
            great forest all by herself for the very first time.

            With a deep breath and a determined little quack, Lola waddled to the edge of the pond. The tall trees of
            the forest loomed ahead, their branches swaying gently in the breeze, as if they were inviting her in. Lola
            smiled, feeling both excited and a little bit nervous. As she took her first step into the forest, little
            did she know that this adventure would teach her something important about kindness, courage, and helping
            others.

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h2 class="card-title">Oh, where could it be?</h2>
                        <p class="card-text">As Lola waddled deeper into the forest, the birds chirped happily overhead,
                            and the leaves rustled beneath her tiny feet. The sunlight filtered through the trees,
                            casting playful shadows on the ground. It was such a beautiful day, but Lola's thoughts were
                            still focused on her first day of school. She walked a little faster, excited to see what
                            the day would bring.

                            Suddenly, she heard a soft, sad voice coming from behind a bush. "Oh, where could it be? I
                            can't find it anywhere!" Lola's little heart fluttered with concern. She hurried over to see
                            who needed help.

                            There, standing with a puzzled look on his face, was a small porcupine. His little quills
                            were puffed up in all directions, and he was looking around frantically, as if he had lost
                            something very important.

                            "Hello! My name's Lola. Are you okay?" she asked with a friendly quack.

                            The porcupine turned around, his face brightening just a little when he saw the kind
                            duckling. "Oh, hello! I'm Percy. I seem to have lost my hat. I was wearing it this morning,
                            and now I can't find it anywhere!"

                            Lola looked at the little porcupine, his quills pointing in every direction. "Your hat?" she
                            asked, tilting her head. "Where was the last place you saw it?"

                            Percy looked confused. "I had it on when I was walking through the forest, but now it's
                            gone! I don’t know where it could be!"

                            Lola thought for a moment, then her eyes widened with an idea. "I think I know where your
                            hat is!" she said. "Let me take a closer look."

                            Lola waddled over to Percy and carefully examined his back. And there it was! His little hat
                            was stuck in the middle of his quills, hidden by all the spiky, soft points.

                            "Percy!" Lola giggled. "Your hat is right there, stuck in your quills! You didn’t lose
                            it—it's been with you all along!"

                            Percy blinked in surprise. "What? Oh my goodness, I didn't even notice! How silly of me."

                            Lola carefully helped Percy untangle his quills, and with a gentle tug, she pulled the
                            little hat free. Percy put it back on his head, smiling from ear to ear.

                            "Thank you so much, Lola!" Percy said, feeling very relieved. "You saved the day! I’m so
                            glad you came along."

                            Lola smiled back. "I’m happy to help, Percy. It’s always good to look carefully before
                            getting too worried!"

                            Percy chuckled. "I’ll remember that! You're a very kind friend, Lola. I hope you have a
                            wonderful first day of school."

                            With a wave goodbye, Lola continued on her way through the forest, feeling even braver than
                            before. She had already helped a new friend, and it felt good to know that sometimes, all it
                            takes is a little bit of kindness—and a careful eye—to make the day a little brighter.

                            As Lola waddled along, she wondered who she would meet next. The adventure was only just
                            beginning!

                        <p class="card-text">As Lola waddled through the forest, she spotted a tiny green worm
                            crying on
                            a red mushroom.

                            Lola tilted her head. "Hey there, what’s wrong?"

                            The worm sniffled, wiping her eyes. "I don’t want to go to flying school! I’m just a
                            worm! I
                            don’t even have wings! How can I possibly fly?"

                            Lola grinned. "Well, guess what? You *are* going to get wings someday!"

                            The worm blinked. "What? How? I’m just a worm!"

                            "You’re going to be a butterfly!" Lola said proudly. "One day, you’ll have beautiful
                            wings
                            and
                            fly all over the place."

                            The worm’s eyes widened. "A butterfly? Really? Me?"

                            "Yep! But here's the thing," Lola added, "You’ve got to be patient. It takes time for
                            your
                            wings
                            to grow, but when they do, you’ll be ready to soar."

                            The worm stared at her little body. "But I don’t have wings now. I want them *now*!"

                            Lola chuckled. "I know, waiting is tough. But good things come to those who are patient.
                            The
                            more you grow and learn, the closer you’ll be to flying."

                            The worm wiped away her last tear and smiled, her hopes lifted. "Okay, I’ll be patient.
                            I’ll
                            give flying school a try and wait for my wings!"

                            "That’s the spirit!" Lola cheered. "Patience will make your wings even more amazing when
                            they
                            finally arrive."

                            With a happy wriggle, the worm scurried off, excited for her butterfly future. Lola
                            waved
                            and
                            waddled on, thinking about how sometimes, a little patience is all we need to get where
                            we
                            want
                            to go.</p>

                        <h2 class="card-title">Be brave</h2>
                        <p class="card-text">Lola continued her journey through the forest, her little wings fluttering
                            with excitement as she thought about the friends she had helped today. The sun was starting
                            to set, casting a warm golden glow across the trees, and Lola felt happy and content. But
                            just as she turned a corner, she heard a faint whimpering sound coming from a nearby bush.

                            Curious, Lola waddled over, her little heart racing with concern. As she got closer, she saw
                            a small fox caught in a rope snare, its fluffy tail twitching in distress. The fox was
                            young, with bright eyes full of fear, and it was struggling to free itself.

                            "Oh no!" Lola gasped, her wings trembling with worry. The little fox was stuck, and it
                            looked so scared.

                            But as Lola took a step closer, she remembered what her mommy had always told her. "Be
                            careful of foxes, Lola. They can be sneaky and tricky, and sometimes, they might even try to
                            hurt you."

                            Lola paused, her little heart torn. She had always been told to stay away from foxes, but
                            this little fox was clearly in trouble. She could see that it was young, just a baby, and it
                            was helpless in the snare. The poor thing was crying for help, and Lola couldn’t just leave
                            it there.

                            "I know I’m supposed to be careful," Lola thought to herself. "But I can't just leave this
                            little fox to suffer. It needs my help, and it’s too small to do anything on its own."

                            Taking a deep breath, Lola decided to trust her instincts. She waddled carefully over to the
                            trapped fox, her mind racing with how to help. The fox’s eyes met hers, filled with fear and
                            uncertainty, but there was also a hint of hope in those eyes, as if it knew Lola was there
                            to help.

                            "Hey there, little one," Lola said gently, trying to calm the frightened fox. "I’m Lola, and
                            I’m here to help. Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you."

                            The baby fox whined softly. "Please, can you help me? I’m stuck and I don’t know what to
                            do!"

                            Lola looked closely at the rope snare. It was tightly wound around the little fox’s leg, and
                            it was digging into its soft fur. Lola knew she had to act carefully, so the fox wouldn’t
                            get hurt even more.

                            "I think I can help," Lola said softly, looking around for something that could help her
                            loosen the rope. She didn’t have sharp claws like other animals, but she was clever and
                            resourceful.

                            She found a sharp stone nearby and used it to carefully cut the rope. It was tricky, but
                            after a few patient snips, the rope finally gave way, and the fox was free! The little fox
                            jumped up in surprise, its fur fluffed up with excitement.

                            "Thank you, thank you!" the baby fox yelped, wagging its tail. "I was so scared, but you
                            saved me!"

                            Lola smiled, feeling proud of herself for making the right choice. "I’m glad I could help,"
                            she said softly. "But you have to be more careful next time. This snare could have really
                            hurt you."

                            The baby fox looked down at the ground, a little embarrassed. "I know, I know. I was just
                            curious and wandered too far. I’ll be more careful from now on."

                            Lola thought for a moment. "I know my mommy always says to be careful around foxes, but I
                            can see you’re just a little one, and you didn’t mean any harm. I’m glad I could help, but
                            remember, the forest can be a dangerous place sometimes, especially if we don’t pay
                            attention."

                            The fox nodded eagerly. "I’ll remember that. Thank you for being kind and helping me when I
                            needed it most."

                            Lola smiled warmly at the little fox. "It’s what friends do. We help each other when we
                            can."

                            With a wag of its tail, the baby fox scampered off into the woods, looking back one last
                            time at Lola. "Goodbye, Lola! Maybe we can be friends!"

                            Lola waved her wing, feeling happy that she had made the right choice. "Goodbye, little fox.
                            Be safe out there!"

                            As Lola continued on her way, she thought about what had just happened. Her mommy had always
                            warned her to be careful of foxes, but today she had learned that sometimes, being kind and
                            helping others—no matter who they are—was the best thing to do. It wasn’t always easy to
                            know what the right thing was, but Lola felt proud that she had trusted her heart.

                            The forest was a big and mysterious place, but Lola knew that with kindness and courage, she
                            could face any challenge that came her way. She looked forward to the rest of her journey,
                            knowing that each new adventure would teach her something important.

                            And so, Lola waddled on, her heart light and full of hope, ready to face whatever came next.

                        <p class="card-text">After her eventful journey through the forest, Lola finally saw it—a little
                            wooden schoolhouse tucked between the trees, with colorful flowers blooming around it. It
                            looked just like the one in her dreams! Lola's heart fluttered with excitement as she
                            waddled up to the entrance. She had made it to school all by herself, and she couldn’t wait
                            to begin her very first day!

                            As she approached the door, she saw other animals waiting outside, chattering excitedly.
                            There were bunnies, squirrels, and even a few other ducklings. They were all talking about
                            their own adventures, sharing stories of what they had done that morning. Lola smiled
                            nervously, but she was also proud of herself. She had faced so many challenges and helped so
                            many friends on the way.

                            Before she could step inside, the door swung open, and out came the teacher—a wise old owl
                            with round glasses perched on her beak. "Good morning, everyone!" the owl called out in a
                            warm, welcoming voice. "Welcome to your first day of school! We’re so happy to have you all
                            here."

                            Lola’s eyes sparkled as she stepped forward. "I’m Lola! I walked through the forest all by
                            myself today," she said proudly. "I helped a porcupine find his hat, a caterpillar named
                            Butter understand flying school, and a baby fox who was stuck in a rope snare."

                            The teacher owl nodded with a smile. "That’s wonderful, Lola! You’ve already shown that you
                            have a kind heart and a brave spirit. I’m sure you’ll make a great student!"

                            Lola blushed a little and looked around at her new classmates. They all seemed so nice, and
                            Lola couldn’t wait to start learning with them.

                            As she entered the schoolhouse, Lola took her seat at a small desk made just for little
                            animals like her. The classroom was cozy, filled with sunlight that streamed through the
                            windows, and there were pictures of animals and plants on the walls.

                            The teacher owl began the first lesson, talking about the wonders of the forest and how
                            every animal had its own important role. Lola listened carefully, her eyes wide with
                            curiosity. There was so much to learn!

                            Throughout the day, Lola made new friends, and they all shared their own adventures too. She
                            learned about the different animals of the forest, how they lived, and how everyone worked
                            together to keep the forest a safe and happy place. Lola even shared her own story about
                            helping others on her journey.

                            As the school bell rang at the end of the day, Lola felt a sense of pride. She had made it
                            through her first day of school, and it had been everything she had hoped for and more. She
                            was tired but happy, and as she waddled home, she knew that there would be many more
                            exciting days ahead.

                            Lola had learned so much already, and she was excited to see where her new adventures would
                            take her next. With her kind heart, brave spirit, and the friends she had made, Lola knew
                            she was ready for whatever the future held.

                            And so, with a happy quack, Lola made her way home, looking forward to tomorrow’s lessons
                            and the many adventures still to come. The forest was her classroom, and each day was a
                            chance to learn, grow, and make the world a little brighter for those around her.
